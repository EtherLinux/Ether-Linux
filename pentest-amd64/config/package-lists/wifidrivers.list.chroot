##
## Make sure we install as many input/video drivers as we can. Note that
## these packages need to be explicitly listed if we want to be sure that
## they're installed. Installing xserver-xorg is not enough to make sure,
## due to its dependencies, defined as such:
##  * xserver-xorg-input-all | xorg-driver-input
##  * xserver-xorg-video-all | xorg-driver-video
##
xserver-xorg-input-all
xserver-xorg-video-all
